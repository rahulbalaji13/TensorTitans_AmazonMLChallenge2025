# Smart Product Pricing Challenge - Solution Documentation

## Team Details
- **Team Name:** TensorTitans
- **Team Members:** Rahul, Sachin, Vamsi, Atul

## Methodology

### 1. Overview

This solution predicts optimal product prices for e-commerce products using a multi-modal deep learning approach, as required by the challenge. We extract and use features from:
- Product text (`catalog_content`)
- Product images (`image_link`)
- Tabular features (extracted Item Pack Quantity, brand label encoding)

### 2. Feature Engineering

#### Tabular Features
- **Item Pack Quantity (IPQ):** Extracted using regex from `catalog_content` (e.g., "Pack of 5", "2 pcs").
- **Brand:** The first word of `catalog_content` is used as a proxy for brand; label encoded for the model.

#### Text Features
- **Text Embeddings:** Used [sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate 384-dimensional semantic embeddings for `catalog_content`. This allows capturing semantics from product titles, descriptions, and specifications.

#### Image Features
- **Image Embeddings:** Used [MobileNetV2](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/) pretrained on ImageNet to extract 1,280-dimensional pooled embeddings from product images. To meet runtime constraints, we process a random subset (5,000) of images per split (train/test), and use the mean embedding of this subset for the remaining products. This balances speed with multi-modal compliance.

### 3. Model Architecture

- **Input:** Concatenation of text embeddings, tabular features, and image embeddings.
- **Neural Net:** A simple but effective MLP:
  - Dense(512) + BatchNorm + Dropout(0.2)
  - Dense(256) + BatchNorm + Dropout(0.15)
  - Dense(64)
  - Dense(1, relu) for price prediction (enforces non-negative prices)
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=1e-3)
- **Loss:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Early Stopping:** On validation MAE, patience=2.

### 4. Training and Validation

- **Validation:** 8% of training data held out for validation to prevent overfitting and enable early stopping.
- **Batch Size:** 1024
- **Epochs:** Up to 15 (early stopped)
- **Scaling:** All numeric/tabular features are MinMax scaled.

### 5. Output Generation

- **Test Predictions:** Model outputs are clipped to be positive, rounded to 2 decimals, and formatted as per the challenge specification (`test_out.csv` with columns: sample_id, price).

### 6. Computational Considerations

- **Image bottleneck:** To avoid long runtimes, we process a subset of images (random 5,000). The rest use the mean image embedding, a common competition trick.
- **Parallelism:** Image feature extraction is batched, and all other operations are vectorized.
- **Runtime:** Entire pipeline runs in under 20 minutes in Google Colab (T4 GPU or TPU). Most time is spent on image downloading and embedding.

## Improvements & Further Work

- Ensemble with gradient boosting (e.g., CatBoost) on tabular/text features.
- Use larger image and text models if more compute is available.
- Experiment with multimodal transformers for further improvement.
